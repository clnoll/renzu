Data Presentation Challenge

Data is our business. Yet all the data in the world would be of no value if there was no way to access it. As such, one of the most important parts of our product is how we choose to present and deliver our data to our customers.

This exercise involves building out a simple view into some data so that a user can easily parse out meaning from the numbers. We have included a csv file that includes roughly a years worth of data for five sample apps. Assuming this was real data handed to you from an api, please build a dashboard that presents that data in graphical form and allows the user to select and filter the data they want to see. Its important that our front-end engineers have a good sense of product as well as strong coding skills, so we have left the details of how the dashboard should work and look to you.
